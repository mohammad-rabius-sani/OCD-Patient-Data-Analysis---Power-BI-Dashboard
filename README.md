# OCD Patient Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing a dataset of OCD (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder) patients, focusing on key demographics and clinical data. The objective is to gain insights into OCD severity, medication usage, and patient trends over time. The analysis was done using Power BI, and the report includes interactive visualizations for easier interpretation.

## Dataset
- **Source**: [OCD Patient Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ohinhaque/ocd-patient-dataset-demographics-and-clinical-data)
- **Records**: 1,500 entries
- **Key Features**: Age, Gender, Ethnicity, Y-BOCS Scores, Medications, Diagnosis Date, etc.

## Tools Used
- **Power BI**: For creating the interactive dashboard and performing visual analysis.
- **Excel/Google Sheets**: Used for initial data cleaning and exploration.
- **SQL (BigQuery/PostgreSQL)**: For querying the dataset (if applicable).

## Key Insights
- The average Y-BOCS score for patients is **39.67**.
- The most common medication prescribed is **Benzodiazepine**.
- **74.27%** of patients are on some form of medication.
- OCD diagnoses trend over time shows moderate fluctuations, with no significant increase or decrease.

## Visualizations
The Power BI dashboard includes:
1. **KPIs**: Summary statistics such as total patients, average Y-BOCS score, and more.
2. **Charts**: Analysis of Y-BOCS scores by age group, medication distribution, and diagnoses over time.
3. **Interactive Slicers**: Filters for age group, gender, ethnicity, medications, and more.

## How to View the Dashboard
You can view the interactive Power BI dashboard by downloading the `.pbix` file and opening it in Power BI Desktop.

## Learnings
- How to clean and analyze healthcare datasets using Power BI.
- Creating dynamic visualizations that help in decision-making.
- Understanding OCD patient demographics and treatment insights.
